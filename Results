Patient (P): I&#39;ve been feeling a bit overwhelmed with everything going on in my life lately.
It&#39;s been hard to cope.
T: I see. It sounds like you have been experiencing increased stress. Can you tell me more
about what has been going on?
P: Well, work has been really demanding, and I constantly feel pressure to meet all the
deadlines. Additionally, I&#39;ve been facing some personal issues within my family, which has
been weighing on me.

your overall well-being. How have you been coping with this?

me in managing my stress levels.
